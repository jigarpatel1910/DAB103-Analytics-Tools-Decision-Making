# Uber Pickups in New York City
Group Project 003

## Dataset Description
This data contains on over 4.5 million Uber pickups in New York City from April to September 2014, and 14.3 million more Uber pickups from January to June 2015. Trip-level data on 10 other for-hire vehicle (FHV) companies, as well as aggregated data for 329 FHV companies, is also included. All the files are as they were received on August 3, Sept. 15 and Sept. 22, 2015.

- The dataset contains, roughly, four groups of files:
    1) Uber trip data from 2014 (April - September): separated by month, with detailed location information
    2) Uber trip data from 2015 (January - June): with less fine-grained location information
    3) Non-Uber FHV (For-Hire Vehicle) trips: The trip information varies by company, but can include day of trip, time of trip, pickup location, driver's for-hire license number, and vehicle's for-hire license number
    4) Aggregate ride and vehicle statistics: for all FHV companies (and, occasionally, for taxi companies

## Background & Motivation

- Uber’s motto to maintain customer’s safety as now it requires all prospective drivers to submit to motor vehicle and criminal background checks. Due to the high standard of services, Uber gain more profits, more demand from their customers and a very busy transportation in New York.

- Through our analysis & perception, we aim to arise up with the solutions to address this Supply-Demand issue and recommend realistic, actionable solutions.

## Problem Statement 

- A comparison of the demand for yellow-cabs and Uber in NYC in 2014 and 2015 shows that the demand for Uber has increased. However, this demand may not be distributed uniformly either spatially or temporally.

- Uber is an app-based transportation network and taxi company. Due to the non-availability of cars, passengers may have to wait for a long time to find a cab or sometimes they cancelled the cab.  

- Overall, these issues impact the business of Uber, and it loses out on its revenue.

## project Proposal

- In this project, our primary approach is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify problems or suggestion, Data Cleaning, and add Visualization by plotting various graphs with proper aesthetics and geometry, clearly displaying important insights.

- Identifying the problems which is useful to maintain demand and supply for customers.

- Try to provide more efficient solutions which is direct benefit to Uber and their customers.

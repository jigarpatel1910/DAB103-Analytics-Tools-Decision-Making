# Uber Pickups in New York City
Group Project 003

## Dataset Description
This data contains on over 4.5 million Uber pickups in New York City from April to September 2014, and 14.3 million more Uber pickups from January to June 2015. Trip-level data on 10 other for-hire vehicle (FHV) companies, as well as aggregated data for 329 FHV companies, is also included. All the files are as they were received on August 3, Sept. 15 and Sept. 22, 2015.

The dataset contains, roughly, four groups of files:
-Uber trip data from 2014 (April - September), separated by month, with detailed location information
-Uber trip data from 2015 (January - June), with less fine-grained location information
-Non-Uber FHV (For-Hire Vehicle) trips. The trip information varies by company, but can include day of trip, time of trip, pickup location, driver's for-hire license number,        and vehicle's for-hire license number.
-Aggregate ride and vehicle statistics for all FHV companies (and, occasionally, for taxi companies)
